Contents of the Meeting # Relevance of the Leitfaden? # Dr. Newe is solely responsible for what is required of us in the project and will do the evaluation almost entirely on his own. The Leitfaden was only a thought-provoking guide for customers with less experience in the IT sector, not a concrete framework for action that has to be implemented in this way. What does the uni expect of us? # All that is important to Dr. Raschke is that in the end, it is clear that we have created reasonable documentation and that it is clear that we planned the project according to good principles before we started the implementation. Important Documentation which is not specifically requested by the customer, but which is important for us as developers, should definitely be created and included in the Pflichtenheft! For example, architecture, used tools, etc. (See Sopra for a rough guide). What about the teammate in his Masters? # It was planned in advance to mix the teams and have masters in (preferably) each team. Therefore, no special requirements have to be fulfilled and only the customer's requirements have to be satisfied. What about the Zwischenpr\u00e4sentation? # The Zwischenpr\u00e4sentation will be either in bazaar form (short presentations after which each team gets a table for questions), or via uploaded video presentations. Similar to the Messe in the Sopra, this will be open to everyone and is meant for people to talk about problems, experiences and ideas with other teams. Note It is not expected that a certain point in the project has been reached by the deadline, but something should be presentable that meets the customer's requirements. Final presentation at the client's company possible? # The final presentation will be similar to the Zwischenpr\u00e4sentation (either bazaar or online).

Formalities # The customer was informed about the meeting with Dr. Raschke and was provided with all relevant information that came out of the conversation. Presentation at NewTec # The client has expressed their interest in a presentation of the final product in the company so that both marketing and human resources can see what the team has developed for the company. Note We are free to choose whether or not we really want to present on site in the end and it has no effect on the grade or project schedule whatsoever. But we are to think about it for the next months and let the customer know in time (sometime after the Zwischenpr\u00e4sentation). Github usage # Please make sure to read the issues really thoroughly in the future and to move/check them in the Kanban board accordingly. Important Please use a separate branch for each issue and don't merge them yourself, but set them to \"Review required\" so that someone else looks over them before the branch is merged. Story extension # The idea of a concrete character selection at the start of the game, instead of creating an own character, was well received by the customer. The customer also suggested that the character/game be placed in a high-fantasy setting to avoid typical problems such as lack of inclusion. Additionally the customer also finds the idea of an orc having a desk job funny. The customer vetoed the addition of several degree options (Bachelor/Master), as this would give a false impression that someone with a higher degree has better chances. The client suggested instead to change \"Company Internship\" to \"Extracurricular Activities\" in order to offer hobbies/projects (e.g.: tinkering with a Raspberry Pi) as interests in addition to internships to increase stats. Both should give on average the same amount of stats, since both are much more relevant for NewTec than the degree. The idea of a company party is a good and should be extended upon. When attending the company party: There should be an opportunity to talk to superiors to have better options in later dialogues or to increase some stats. Furthermore, there should be a possibility to drink (different drinks with different percentages) which can lead to deadline problems due to a hangover. In case of non-participation in the company party: There should be a stat increase in programming and the possibility to correct deadline problems. However, future dialouge advantages are lost because one does not get into the conversation with the superiors. All other proposals have been rejected for various reasons and should be reconsidered for the next sprint-review. Online-voting-tool # Due to the fact that there is no suitable online voting tool, it is likely that we will switch to implementing our own solution. The customer will discuss a few things internally so that the team can use the customer's server for this purpose if the customer decides to use self-hosting until the next sprint review. Note If it should happen that we have to implement the server ourselves, it should be set up with Docker. Issues to fix # The Glossary, Requirements, Use-Case diagrams, Architecture diagram and all associated texts have to fix the following oversights: The StoryPlayer is longer a part of the game and has to be replaced with Moderator in all documents. Please remember to adapt the descriptions in the glossary accordingly. The Audience is longer a part of the game and has to be replaced with PlayerAudience in all documents.

Therefore I would like to ask everyone to implement these improvements by 2020.10.09, so that the customer has enough time to review them before the next review. Important I would therefore personally ask everyone to look at the documents and diagrams that have been produced so far and to check them for possible errors so that the acceptance can take place as smoothly as possible. In doing so, one should look at what one has NOT done oneself in order to have another review procedure. Copyright Issues # The customer was advised that many of the assets provided were for direct use only and can not be legally distributed via github. Understanding the underlaying issue, the customer then provided the following options to choose from: The team continues to work with the provided assets and removes them from the Github Repo for the open source release to avoid legality issues. The team continues to work with the provided assets and creates placeholder graphics (e.g.: coloured rectangles) to replace the problematic assets for the open source release to avoid legality problems. The team searches for new assets from the Internet, which are completely royalty free and can be published on the repo without any problems. The team creates completely new assets for everything that is needed to avoid problems that can arise from using third-party assets. Important The team is asked to make a decision on the above mentioned issues by the next review (2020.10.16). Monster SFX # The customer bought the team an SFX pack which can be easily integrated into Github and contains several hundred SFX of monster sounds. These can then be used for \"dialogue sounds\" or off-camera sounds. Note These assets also fall under the issue described above. Technical specifications changelog # The customer said that he does not care about what happened before the first approval of the Technical Specification, so there is no need for versioning before that date. The changelog should list any changes to the Technical Specifications between a specific period of time, so that in future the customer only needs to look at the changelog to find out what has changed.

Please add this to the class diagram. (The customer named the \"Facade pattern\" as a possible solution.) The component diagram for the server is still missing and should be added.
