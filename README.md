# Quality Quest

## Prerequisites

This software includes a web-based client which will be hosted directly by the software in form of a website. This website will inevitably need to save game-specific data, requiring the host to provide legal texts regarding `cookies` and general `terms of service` (see [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/)). Moreover the host might also need to provide a `Legal Notice` or `About` page, depending on the hosts location. 
We provide placeholders for these purposes which can be replaced, or removed, depending on your needs. Said placeholders are located as following:
- **Cookies and Terms of Service:** `../ServerLogic/PAClient/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`
- **Terms of Service:** `../ServerLogic/PAClient/TermsOfService.cshtml`
- **Privacy:** `../ServerLogic/PAClient/Privacy.cshtml`
- **About:** `../ServerLogic/PAClient/About.cshtml`

**We highly recommend setting everything up according to legal requirements, regardless of the location of the host and the userbase, to circumvent possible future issues with the law and law enforcement.**

## Setup

_Do your thing Elias_

## How to use the Server

_Do your thing again Elias - Oh and we should probably put the `help` thingy from the shell here once we are 100% certain the commands won't change anymore_

## Maintenance / Known issues

_Idk, is there stuff that could easily go wrong and some "easy" fixes or whatever? Couldn't hurt to list them here then!_
