Use this document to list ideas you think could be useful or interesting to implement into QualityQuest further down the line.
Please make sure to only list ideas and not fully fletched concepts, since those might never be used or discarded.
If possible, please make sure to put the idea below your name, so we can identify whose idea it was, if we ever happen to use it - Thank you!
