## Contents of the Meeting

### Review feedback

Due to the short period of time and the large number of changes, the customer was only able to carry out a somewhat rough review of the material. However, the customer had nothing to complain about; on the contrary, praise and greetings were even given to everyone for doing such a good job.

### QR Codes

The customer has suggested that this may use the NewTec QR Code solution if desired. He will discuss internally, if this is okay and will probably inform us about this in the next review. Otherwise it is also okay to use the options the team has found so far. Those would be [Option 1](https://github.com/huysentruitw/barcoder) or [Option 2](https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator).
