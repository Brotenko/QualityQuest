## Contents of the Meeting

### Presentation video feedback

The client liked the presentation video so far and, in his words, it is "well presentable". No further comments, criticism or suggestions for improvement were made.

### PA-Client feedback 

The functionality of the PlayerAudience-Client has been completely approved and can be used for the final product in its current state. 

Apart from that, the client still mentioned the following possible changes, but they only need to be implemented if the team still has the necessary time to do so:

- If an audience member is too slow to make a selection, it should be specifically mentioned that they were too slow.
- The voting results should be visually displayed in the PlayerAudience-Client.

### Personalized Docker-Image Release

Because many aspects of the PlayerAudience-Client require personalized customization, a personalized Docker-Image is created for the client that contains all the desired data.

### PA-Client technicalities

The following technicalities and legal matters are still pending with regard to Quality Quest: 

- An internal ticket regarding an HTTPS-compliant certificate has been created, but a response is still pending.
- It is still open if the use of the NewTec logo on the OpenSource release version of the website is allowed or if they have to be removed for the OpenSource release.  Feedback on this is still pending.

### Assets feedback

The following specific statements were made regarding the existing assets:

- For the meeting room, the version with light blue sky and less pixelated clouds should be used.
- "praktika_b_1080.png" should be used.
- Laptops should also be animated if possible, and look something [like this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7f/89/42/7f89421f894717c5a59647627884d4ff.gif).
  
Regarding the specific feedback requested on whether the customer likes the current assets, the following was said:

- The team is intentionally given freedom in the design of the assets, and only given a rough direction with the desired style.
- It is important to the customer that the end result **"[...] es ist tauglich f√ºr den Erwartungszweck, und muss nicht ihm gefallen."**. The customer does not have to like the assets personally and does not have personal expectations according to the assets, especially because the customer himself is color-blind.
- As the assets are now, they are suitable for the desired expectation purpose and one should not put too many more efforts and time into it, because the assets can be easily exchanged after the project has been delivered, if the customer later prefers a different design.

### Unity Integration-Test vs. Unit-Tests

The customer desires a test coverage of 60% for both integration tests and unit tests for the Moderator-Client, as the customer expects both types of tests to be performed.

!!! important
    If in the future it turns out that for some reason the coverage cannot be achieved, it is theoretically negotiable as long as there are good reasons for it.

### Next meeting

In consultation with the customer, the Scrum-Master suggested holding the next meeting together with the Usability Lead in order to be able to skip the middle man and solve problems and questions in a direct way.
