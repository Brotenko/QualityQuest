## Contents of the Meeting

### First presentation of the first draft of the second milestone

The created diagrams, protocols and texts were presented to the customer and for the most part accepted without contradiction. Due to lack of time, however, a closer look at the changes, and a discussion of them, will follow in the following week. The few things that came up during the meeting can be seen below and should be fixed by the date below.

### ToDo for the next week

A list of items to be completed and reviewed by 23:00 on 2020.11.16:

- **Network protocol:**
  - Fix confusion with MessageTypeEnum elements being fields of the MessageContainer and simultaneously being the name of the inheriting class.
  - New MessageType for the Server to send to the Moderator-Client in intervals to inform the moderator about the number of people that already connected to the game.
- **Component design:**
  - If the Logger-system is a singleton, then that should be declared by marking it <code><<Singleton>></code>. If not, then it should be declared further how exactly it works.
- **StoryFlow:**
  - The deadline should not be used as a reason for termination, at the end of the game.
- **Glossary/Requirements:**
  - Add/Delete/Change glossary entries and requirements as necessary to make sure the new changes are apparent.

### Soft deadline and next review-meeting

Due to the high number of changes and the excessive number of diagrams, not everything could be discussed during the review. Therefore it was agreed to hold an unscheduled review with the customer on 2020.11.19 at 11:30. Until then the customer wants to have looked at all changes and mark possible improvements/problems to discuss them.

For this purpose the current status of the document must be ready for submission by Monday night.
