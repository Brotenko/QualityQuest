## Contents of the Meeting

### Moderator-Client artwork presentation
                            
The Usability Lead joined this meeting to personally present the resulting artwork for the Moderator-Client to the client to get direct feedback from the client and to have the opportunity to discuss the various nuances with the client directly. 

### Next meeting

Due to the upcoming exam period, the team has decided in consultation with the customer to suspend the next meeting, as nothing will be produced in the next two weeks that would put a meeting into perspective.
Therefore, the next meeting will be held on the next regularly scheduled date, 2021-03-19 at 13:00.
