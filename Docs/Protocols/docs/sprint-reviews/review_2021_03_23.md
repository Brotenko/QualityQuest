## Contents of the Meeting

### Organization of the technical handover

Due to internal company circumstances, the customer has not yet been able to find a suitable date, but has agreed to increase his efforts to find a suitable date in the next few days.

### Unity-Client menu

The basic features of the Moderator-Client implemented so far were presented and demonstrated to the customer. Also the ongoing structure of the underlying architecture was roughly discussed with the customer. Both were approved by the customer without any further objections, but the customer would be happy to see the game in action at the next meeting.

### Project submission and grading

In the conversation with the customer, specifications about grading and delivery have been asked about, from which a few important pieces of information have emerged:

- The customer would like to hold a joint meeting in MS Teams after the final delivery. There, in a group meeting, the team and the customer will first talk about the actual software and how the product holds up in terms of quality. In the subsequent individual meetings, the customer then want to talk to everyone individually about their own performance, where they are to critically evaluate themselves as well as the others and what everyone has done.
- Suggested dates for the submission are **2021-05-06 13:00-15:00** or **2021-05-07 13:30-15:30**. Confirmation about the exact date is expected atws the next meeting.
- The deadline is much less important to the customer than the quality of the product. Obviously the product should be ready by the deadline, but even if we the team needs a week longer than expected by the deadline, its okay. Product quality and other university achievements are more important to customer, than the deadline.
