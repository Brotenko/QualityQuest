## Contents of the Meeting

### Presentation of the concept art 

The client was presented with the various concepts that the team had developed. These were then, due to lack of time, skimmed over in a shortened version and discussed with the Scrum Master. However, as there was no time to take a closer look and the client wanted to think about the whole thing again, the concepts were sent by e-mail. 

The client agreed to give feedback on the concepts until the next meeting.

### PlayerAudience-Client website

A first version of the PlayerAudience-Client, in the form of a website, was presented to the client. This was accepted and is to be expanded on the basis of the current concept.

### Legality issues regarding the website

The customer was made aware of the problem that a terms of service, a data protection declaration, an imprint, a cookie declaration and given other regulations must be fulfilled by the website. Hereupon, two things were agreed upon: 

- For the OpenSource version of the project, the respective files of the website shall be left blank so that they can be filled out by the users themselves.
- For the version that will be handed over to NewTec, the client will discuss this again with the internal IT and legal departments and will contact the team accordingly.
