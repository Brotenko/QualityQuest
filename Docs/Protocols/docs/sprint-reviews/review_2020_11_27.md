## Contents of the Meeting

### New Coding Styleguide

After consultation with the customer, it turned out that the current Coding Styleguide is not optimal and does not make much sense for the project, as it is largely based on C/C++ and is not perfectly compatible with C#. Therefore the customer suggested to use "FxCop" instead, which is provided by Microsoft and can be installed via NuGet.

!!! information
    FxCop is a code analyser which checks the code for consistency and compliance with the Coding Styleguide used by Microsoft. More details about FxCop and how to install it can be found online.
