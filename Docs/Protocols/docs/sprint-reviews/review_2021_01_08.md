## Contents of the Meeting

### RE: Legality issues regarding the website

The in-house legal department was not available for the client over the holidays, which is why the [issue discussed in the last meeting](../sprint-reviews/review_2020_12_18.md#legality-issues-regarding-the-website) can only be resolved in the next meeting. In addition to this the customer will also ask the internal IT about certificates regarding HTTPS.

### RE: Presentation of the concept art 

The [concepts presented at the last meeting](../sprint-reviews/review_2020_12_18.md#presentation-of-the-concept-art) were carefully considered by the client, who then decided on the following:

- "Design1.pdf" should be used for the Moderator-Client, with the appendix that the rounded buttons and menus of "M-Client.pdf Vorschlag 4" should be used. 
  - Regarding character selection: Page 9
  - Regarding decisions: Page 12
  - Regarding results: Page 13
- The colours of the UI should be adapted to (predominantly) use the colours of the NewTec logo. 
  - For other colours, [this website](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) should be used to ensure that there is accessibility for colour blind people.

### Visual Novel vs. Interactive movie

After consultation with the client, they decided that the game should be realised in a "visual novel" style in the future. The reason for this was the reduced amount of work for the team and the fact that the game principle works well with it.

The backgrounds are to continue in the current (90s 3D PC game) style, with the addition that the backgrounds must be animated so that the game does not feel like a PowerPoint. 

!!! Examples
    Moving waves, flickering screens, blowing trees, fluttering screen, moving mouths, showing emotions in the characters faces.

### More concept art and assets

The new concepts and assets were presented to the client, who then decided to go for the "Visual Novel"-esque style. 

### Website feedback

The website is still in accordance with the client's wishes and can be continued in the same way.
