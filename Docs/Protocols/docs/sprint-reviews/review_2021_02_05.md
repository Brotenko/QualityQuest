## Contents of the Meeting

### Project completion relevant documents and files

The following is a list of relevant topics that have arisen in relation to the final submission of the project.

#### Final presentation

The client does not require a separate presentation for his company only, but would like the team to contact Dr. Raschke to find out how the final presentation will be delivered within the university and, depending on this, one of the following options should be considered:

- **Video presentations:** Should the presentation be implemented in pure video form, the client would like to receive the video of the presentation in order to pass it on within the company.
- **Live presentation:** In case of a live presentation, the client asks that a list of stakeholders be present during the presentation to ask questions if necessary.
- **A different approach:** If a different approach to the above options is chosen, the client would like to receive feedback in order to be able to plan more precisely.

#### Relevant documents

For the final submission, the client only requires the submission of the technical specifications in the form of the website already in use. A submission in PDF format is not necessary.

#### Technical handover

The client asks for a meeting to be organised via Microsoft Teams 2 weeks before final delivery, where a team member explains to the client, stakeholders and in-house IT how the software works, how it is operated, and how it is theoretically to be maintained should problems or change requests arise.

### Integration-Tests for PlayerAudience-Client

The client does not require integration tests for the PlayerAudience-Client and the server. If the team has a lot of time to spare, they are welcome to implement integration tests, but it is not required of the server and PlayerAudience-Client in any form.

### Next meeting

Due to a number of technical problems on the side of the Usability Lead and a tight schedule of the client, the meeting with the Usability Lead is postponed to the date of 19.02.2021 at 13:15.
