## Contents of the Meeting

### Technical Specifications feedback

The customer's feedback on the Technical Specifications was reviewed in detail by going over the provided feedback-document and talking about the specific changes wanted.

### Moderator-Client

Since the use case diagram for the moderator client is too chronological, the client asked to split the diagram into three sub-diagrams to specify the individual use cases and avoid possible problems. <br>
The following splits are supposed to be made:

- **Start Application:** For possible configurations pre-game and setting up connections.
- **Play Story:** The actual gameplay.
- **End Application:** Post-game stats/information/data/etc.

### Component diagrams

The component diagrams should be adapted to the typical notation (offering and accepting interfaces between components).

### HTML and PDF documentation

The customer has given the ok to document the project in the form of MkDocs, and therefore HTML. This means that the use and delivery of DOCX files is no longer necessary and can be removed from the Technical Specifications. However, it is essential that a PDF is delivered for the final submission of the project.

### Uni-Server and team restructuring

The customer was informed about the restructuring of the team and the setup of the uni-server.
