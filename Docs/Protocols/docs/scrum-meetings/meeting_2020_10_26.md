In order to implement the customer's feedback as accurately and fairly as possible, the team discussed the following three issues and arrived at the respective results:

- **Method of implementing UUID's:** Web-Cookies
- **Selection of characters to be offered at the start of the game:** 4
- **Minimum number of clients the server should be able to support:** 200

### Use-Case consulation

Regarding the customer's feedback on the use-case diagrams, it was determined that "play game" should be used instead of "make decision". It was also discussed at which points, which actors are relevant for the respective diagrams.
