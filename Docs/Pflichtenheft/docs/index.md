# Introduction
In this project a serious game is to be developed, 
in which the audience can interactively determine the decisions in the course of the game. 
At the beginning of the game the audience can choose from several player characters.
The subsequent decisions made by vote influence the further course of the game, 
either by improving skills and thus better chances for random decisions or by the consequences of bad decisions.
The goal is to be invited to a prestigious workshop in Hawaii through good work.

# Motivation
The image of the software developer is still strongly influenced by the clich√© of the nerd living in his parents' basement who does whole projects on his own.
However, due to the increasing focus on teamwork, readability and quality assurance, this has practically nothing in common with reality, 
so the game is intended to show the audience a contemporary picture of software development in a realistic and 
humorous way. The decisions made in the game are intended to demonstrate the skills required for this profession and show the positive effects of good practices in software development. 

# Vision
The game should have an appealing and clear presentation, and the spectators should be able to participate easily via their cell phones. The moderator should be able to continue 
the game if there are connection problems, and to pause voting if needed. The story should be played through within twenty minutes.

# Context of Project
QualityQuest is developed within a software project of the University of Ulm in cooperation with NewTec, represented by Dr. Axel Newe, and shall be published as OpenSource.
