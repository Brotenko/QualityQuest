in which the audience can interactively determine the decisions in the course of the game. **[...]**


# Motivation
The everyday life of a prospective software developer should be conveyed to students in a realistic and

and show the consequences of short-sighted decisions. **[...]**

# Vision
The game should have an appealing and clear presentation, and the spectators should be able to participate easily via their cell phones. The moderator should be able to pause 
the game if there are connection problems, and the story should be played through within twenty minutes. **[...]**

# Context of Project
