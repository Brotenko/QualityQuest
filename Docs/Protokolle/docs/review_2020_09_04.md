## Contents of the Meeting

### Use-Case diagrams

Quality Quest is used "in-house" and is open source. This means
that the product is not commercially marketed and is made available
on a public repository after the development process is complete.

### About the Pflichtenheft

Scrum is used as the development model for Quality Quest.

### StoryFlow diagram

A private github repository is used as a version control system,
which is made public after the development process is finished.

### Audience as Player

Most of the sprint reviews will be held in an online environment
and via a Microsoft team. They will take place in a 2-week rhythm
on Fridays, with the customer and the Scrum-Master.

### Script-based game

Music, graphics, SFX and the like will be provided by the customer,
but can be added on to at will as long as this extension does not
cost money.

### Pause-button

If possible, an existing service with a corresponding API should be
used as server. This service may contain advertising, but must not
cost money.
