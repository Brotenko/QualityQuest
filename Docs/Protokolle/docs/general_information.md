# Welcome to the Scrum-Meeting Protocols

The documentation of the protocols will be written in markdown (.md) for easier viewing and reading through Github. This also allows us to create a HTML/CSS/JS output via MkDocs whenever needed.

## Document structure

The document is split up in three different sections for easier viewing and reading.

|Section           |Content    |
|:----------------:|:---------:|
|**Sprint-Reviews**|_Protocols of the conducted sprint-reviews held with the Scrum-Master and the customer._|
|**Scrum-Meetings**|_Protocols of the conducted scrum-meetings held with the Scrum-Master and the team._|
|**Miscellaneous** |_Protocols of miscellaneous mettings conducted with people that are not directly involved with the project._|
