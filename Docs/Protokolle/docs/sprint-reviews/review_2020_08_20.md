## Contents of the Meeting

### Intended use

Quality Quest is used "in-house" and is open source. This means
that the product is not commercially marketed and is made available
on a public repository after the development process is complete.

### Development model

Scrum is used as the development model for Quality Quest.

### Version control

A private github repository is used as a version control system,
which is made public after the development process is finished.

### Sprint reviews

Most of the sprint reviews will be held in an online environment
and via a Microsoft team. They will take place in a 2-week rhythm
on Fridays, with the customer and the Scrum-Master.

### Assets

Music, graphics, SFX and the like will be provided by the customer,
but can be added on to at will as long as this extension does not
cost money.

### Server

If possible, an existing service with a corresponding API should be
used as server. This service may contain advertising, but must not
cost money.

### Development environment

Using C#, Unity and Visual Studio 2017 to develop Quality Quest is
allowed.

### Team-internal decisions

Decisions about graphic style, concrete game-mechanics,
player-audience-motivation and the like are left to the team as
long as this has been agreed and approved in consultation with the
customer.

### First Sprint-review

First sprint review of a rough draft of the requirements
specification (form-free) on Friday, 04.09.2020 at 13:00. This
draft should contain first requirements, use case diagrams and use
case descriptions.
