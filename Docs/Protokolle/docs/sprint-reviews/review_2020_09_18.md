## Contents of the Meeting

### MkDocs usage

The use of MkDocs has been approved by the customer as long as it is possible to create a PDF version of the documents. If this is not possible, the customer should be consulted whether another documentation tool should be used or whether MkDocs can still be used.

### Formalities

The customer was informed about the [meeting with Dr. Raschke](/miscellaneous/misc_2020_09_14/) and was provided with all relevant information that came out of the conversation.

### Presentation at NewTec

The client has expressed their interest in a presentation of the final product in the company so that both marketing and human resources can see what the team has developed for the company.

!!! note
    We are free to choose whether or not we really want to present on site in the end and it has no effect on the grade or project schedule whatsoever. But we are to think about it for the next months and let the customer know in time (sometime after the Zwischenpr√§sentation). 

### Github usage

Please make sure to read the issues really thoroughly in the future and to move/check them in the Kanban board accordingly. 

!!! important
    Please use a separate branch for each issue and don't merge them yourself, but set them to "Review required" so that someone else looks over them before the branch is merged.

### Story extension

- The idea of a concrete character selection at the start of the game, instead of creating an own character, was well received by the customer.
    - The customer also suggested that the character/game be placed in a high-fantasy setting to avoid typical problems such as lack of inclusion. Additionally the customer also finds the idea of an orc having a desk job funny.
- The customer vetoed the addition of several degree options (Bachelor/Master), as this would give a false impression that someone with a higher degree has better chances.
    - The client suggested instead to change "Company Internship" to "Extracurricular Activities" in order to offer hobbies/projects (e.g.: tinkering with a Raspberry Pi) as interests in addition to internships to increase stats. Both should give on average the same amount of stats, since both are much more relevant for NewTec than the degree.
- The idea of a company party is a good and should be extended upon.
    - **When attending the company party:** There should be an opportunity to talk to superiors to have better options in later dialogues or to increase some stats. Furthermore, there should be a possibility to drink (different drinks with different percentages) which can lead to deadline problems due to a hangover.
    - **In case of non-participation in the company party:** There should be a stat increase in programming and the possibility to correct deadline problems. However, future dialouge advantages are lost because one does not get into the conversation with the superiors.
- All other proposals have been rejected for various reasons and should be reconsidered for the next sprint-review.

### Online-voting-tool

Due to the fact that there is no suitable online voting tool, it is likely that we will switch to implementing our own solution. The customer will discuss a few things internally so that the team can use the customer's server for this purpose if the customer decides to use self-hosting until the next sprint review.

!!! note
    If it should happen that we have to implement the server ourselves, it should be set up with Docker.

### Issues to fix

The Glossary, Requirements, Use-Case diagrams, Architecture diagram and all associated texts have to fix the following oversights:

- The **StoryPlayer** is longer a part of the game and has to be replaced with **Moderator** in all documents.
    - Please remember to adapt the descriptions in the glossary accordingly.
- The **Audience** is longer a part of the game and has to be replaced with **PlayerAudience** in all documents.
    - Please remember to adapt the descriptions in the glossary accordingly.
- The Pflichtenheft should be given an English name.

### Tasks for the next weeks

- The architecture diagram must be further developed, including class interface diagram.
- The Pflichtenheft issue on the github must be completed.
- [The issues mentioned above](#issues-to-fix) are to be adressed and fixed.
- The StoryFlow diagram must be revised according to the story changes.
