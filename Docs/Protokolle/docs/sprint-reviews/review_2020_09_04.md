## Contents of the Meeting

### Use-Case diagrams

The use case diagrams are far too detailed. Concrete technical solutions and system states are not interesting for the customer. It should be described on an abstract level, using self-contained statements. 

!!! note
    In the audience client something like "Decision Voting" is sufficient, because sending the answer is part of it. 
    In the next step the audience-client would be represented as an actor for the server-client. And the step following that one, the player and server client are the actors of the StoryPlayer client. 
    This means that the diagram has to be completely reworked and abstracted and implemented without technical solutions. 
    The diagram we have at the moment is not be "thrown away", but converted into a different diagram type that fits better and included in the requirements specification, because it might be relevant for us, as the dev team, later on to have defined the technical procedure.

### About the Pflichtenheft

Decisions on technical aspects should be listed in the Pflichtenheft. 

!!! note
    That means: Which engine is used, which language, which IDE, which voting service, which medium for voting, etc. 
    All of these should be accompanied with explanations as to why to use them, links to resources and similar stuff. 

!!! important
    We are to agree on a list of potential voting services within 2 weeks (18.09.2020).

### StoryFlow diagram

The StoryFlow should be modeled into an activity diagram. So what is in the PowerPoint should become a diagram.

### Re-definition of terms

Extend and modify requirements based on the new changes.

|Before       | After            | Context                            |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|:-------------------------------- -:|
|StoryPlayer  |**Moderator**     |_The StoryPlayer is now the Moderator and is no longer necessarily included in the game flow. He only observes the game, comments on it and takes over in an emergency if the server connection is interrupted._                                    | 
|Audience     |**PlayerAudience**|_The Audience is now the actual player. All decisions in the course of the game should now be made by online voting and control the game - the former StoryPlayer has now been replaced for higher audience integration._                       |

<br/>

!!! note
    Every mention of the terms should be revised to correspond to the new terms.

### Script-based game

The game is now completely script-based, which means that manual control is completely eliminated. If the PlayerAudience decides on a selection option, it is executed and automatically executed by the game, without anyone interacting with the PlayerClient itself, besides the server. 

!!! note
    This functionality should be able to be interrupted at any time if there is a problem with the voting feature. In this case the moderator should be able to make manual decisions ("Switch to Offline Mode" button built in).

### Pause-button

Pause button for the moderator to stop the voting timer to have more time to explain something.
